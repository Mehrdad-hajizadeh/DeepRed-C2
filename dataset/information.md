# TUC-RedTeam30 Dataset for NIDS Benchmarking

This dataset, called TUC-RedTeam30, was collected during 30 distinct red teaming exercises conducted in a controlled and isolated environment. It serves as part of the artifact accompanying our USENIX WOOT'25 paper, _"DeepRed: A Deep Learning‚ÄìPowered Command and Control Framework for Multi-Stage Red Teaming Against ML-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems."_

Each scenario in the dataset represents a unique red team engagement designed to evaluate and challenge machine learning‚Äìbased network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Detailed descriptions of all 30 scenarios can be found in Appendix A of the paper.

üìÅ The dataset is also publicly available on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/15662906?preview=1].
