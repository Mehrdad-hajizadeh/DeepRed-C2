# WebSocket Network Monitoring Tool

This repository contains a WebSocket-based client-server Python application developed for real-time network monitoring using `scapy`. It was created as an artifact accompanying our USENIX Security 2024 paper.

---

## 📦 Contents

- `server.py` — WebSocket server that listens for network packet events.
- `client.py` — WebSocket client that receives and logs data.
- `ConfigGenerator.py` — Generates runtime configurations.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `run-server.sh` / `run-client.sh` — Wrapper scripts for execution.
- `Dockerfile` (optional) — Containerized version for reproducible runs.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
- **Python:** 3.8+
- **Privileges:** Root is required (due to `scapy` using raw sockets)
